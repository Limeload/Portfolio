Congratulations! You’ve successfully completed a rigorous coding bootcamp, equipped with the skills needed to excel in the tech industry. However, the journey doesn’t end there. Transitioning from bootcamp to securing your dream job can be daunting, especially when it comes to maintaining discipline and focus. Too often, bootcamp graduates find themselves struggling to stay on track during this crucial period. But fear not, there are actionable steps you can take to keep yourself disciplined and focused on your goal.

## Why am I writing this blog?

Reflecting on my own journey, I recognize the importance of utilizing the right resources to maintain self-discipline after graduating from a bootcamp. I’ll admit, I wasted valuable time by not tapping into the available support systems and falling into the trap of monotonous job applications on various platforms. It’s easy to believe that our final projects and acquired skills are enough to secure entry-level or internship positions, but we often overlook the fact that our abilities require constant nurturing and growth. The gap between graduation and landing a job can inadvertently stagnate our learned skills if we’re not proactive in seeking opportunities for improvement.

And I hope that by sharing my experience, I can help others who might find themselves making the same mistakes I did. Remember, we’re all in this together, and by supporting each other and sharing our experiences, we can empower one another to achieve our goals in the tech industry.

## Let’s get into the action plan —

**Chingu.io:** One of the best decisions you can make post-bootcamp is to join a supportive community like Chingu.io. Chingu.io provides a platform for collaboration, networking, and accountability. By joining a group of like-minded individuals, you’ll have access to resources, encouragement, and opportunities to collaborate on projects. This not only keeps you engaged but also helps you stay disciplined as you work towards your job search goals.

**Volunteer with Non-Profit Organizations:** Consider volunteering with organizations like Hack for LA or other non-profits to gain hands-on experience while actively searching for a job. Having relevant experience on your resume, even if it’s through volunteer work, can make you stand out to potential employers. Plus, it demonstrates your commitment to using your skills for social good, which can be a valuable asset in the tech industry.

**Tech Fleet and Apprentice Roles:** Another invaluable resource for bootcamp graduates is Tech Fleet, which offers opportunities to work on real-world projects and gain practical experience. Additionally, consider seeking out apprentice roles within companies or startups. These roles provide hands-on learning experiences under the guidance of seasoned professionals. While not as common as traditional entry-level positions, apprentice roles offer a unique opportunity to learn and grow within a supportive environment. By actively pursuing apprentice roles and engaging with platforms like Tech Fleet, you can gain valuable experience, expand your skill set, and increase your chances of landing your dream job in the tech industry. Stay disciplined, stay focused, and keep striving towards your goals. Success is within reach!

**MLH Fellowship:** The MLH (Major League Hacking) Fellowship program is a fantastic opportunity for bootcamp graduates looking to gain hands-on experience and expand their skills in the tech industry.
