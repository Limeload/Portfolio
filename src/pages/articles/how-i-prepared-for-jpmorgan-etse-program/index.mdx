Landing a spot in the prestigious Emerging Talent Software Engineer (ETSE) program at JPMorgan Chase is no small feat. It requires dedication, strategic preparation, and a healthy dose of nerves. But fear not, aspiring coders! I’m here to share my personal attempt on highlighting the steps I took to conquer the ETSE application process.

## Building a Strong Foundation:

My journey began with solidifying my grasp of Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA). [Neetcode.io](https://neetcode.io/) was my go-to resource, providing a structured approach to learning fundamental concepts. To test my mettle, I tackled LeetCode problems, starting with the infamous [“75 Blind”](https://leetcode.com/discuss/general-discussion/460599/blind-75-leetcode-questions) list. This built my confidence and gave me a taste of the challenges to come.

## JPMorgan Focus:

Equipped with a solid foundation, I shifted my focus to [JPMorgan-tagged LeetCode problems](https://leetcode.com/company/jpmorgan/). Practicing these LeetCode questions helped me understand the company’s expectations and tailor my preparation accordingly.

## Mastering the Platform:

To conquer HackerRank, I knew I needed platform-specific training. So, I diligently tackled the [Java fundamentals](https://www.hackerrank.com/domains/java) track, familiarizing myself with the interface and nuances of the platform. This made me feel comfortable and confident, ready to unleash my problem-solving skills without any technical hiccups. If you’re not familiar with Java, you can practice with Python, C# as an alternative programming language to attend the initial interview with JPMC.

Time is of the essence in technical interviews. To master efficiency, I started setting timers for each LeetCode problem. I embraced *“pseudocoding”*, jotting down a solution structure before diving into the code. This saved time and prevented me from getting tangled in a coding labyrinth.

## Mastering the Art of Interviewing:

An example of behavioral question using interview.study platform

The HireVue round is where your soft skills shine. To polish my behavioral answers, I used the AI platform [interview.study](https://www.interview.study/). This innovative platform provided prompts and feedback, helping me refine my communication and project confidence. But how do you turn past experiences into compelling narratives that resonate with an AI interviewer?

Here’s how I made it work:

**S is for Situation:** Briefly set the scene. Paint a picture of the context for your chosen experience. Was it a team project? A client challenge? Remember, details are key!

**T is for Task:** Define your role in the situation. What were your specific responsibilities? What was the goal you were trying to achieve?

**A is for Action:** This is where your initiative shines. Describe the exact steps you took to tackle the challenge. Highlight your critical thinking, problem-solving skills, and collaboration (if relevant).

**R is for Result:** Quantify your success! Did you meet the objective? What was the impact of your actions? Use numbers, metrics, or positive outcomes to showcase your effectiveness.

## Beyond Just Code:

The ETSE program seeks well-rounded individuals. Recognizing the emphasis on full-stack Java development, I delved into the fundamentals of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP). This theoretical understanding was then translated into practice through the creation of a technical project. Building this project solidified my grasp of the language and showcased my ability to apply knowledge in real-world scenarios.

**Remember:**
* **Consistency is key:** Dedicate daily time to practice, even if it’s just for 30 minutes.

* **Embrace the learning curve:** Don’t get discouraged by mistakes. Analyze them, learn, and move forward.

* **Build a support system:** Surround yourself with like-minded individuals who can motivate and guide you.

* **Stay positive and confident:** Believe in yourself and your abilities.

## …and the Journey Continues!

Right now, my heart is racing with anticipation as I wait for the Superday final round of the ETSE program. It’s been a whirlwind of learning, practicing, and pushing myself to new heights. Every step, every solved problem, every confident interview answer has brought me closer to this dream opportunity.

If I’m fortunate enough to secure my spot, I promise to return to this blog and share the exhilarating experience with you all. From the interview nerves to the triumphant moment of acceptance (fingers crossed!), I’ll document it all, hoping to inspire others and offer even more insights into navigating the ETSE challenge.

So, stay tuned! This story is far from over. And who knows, maybe your journey to the ETSE program starts right here, fueled by the lessons learned and the hope shared in this little corner of the internet.
